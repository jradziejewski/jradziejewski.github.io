## Introduction
Metal music has evolved significantly throughout the years. Starting from Black Sabbath, the fathers of heavy metal, finishing on modern very talented and skillet artists. In this article I want to explore the lyrical landscape of music by analyzing top 50 user-rated albums from each decade.
## Methodology
<br>

#### 1. Data Collection
- Top 50 albums of each decade were scraped using Python library `BeautifulSoup` from [AlbumOfTheYear.org](https://www.albumoftheyear.org/)
- Then, for each album the lyrics were retrieved using `lyricsgenius` package and then cleaned up using custom scripts.
#### 2. Data Analysis
- Python library, `nltk` was used to analyze sentiment of songs.
- Wordclouds generated using `some library etc` and visualized using `matplotlib`.
