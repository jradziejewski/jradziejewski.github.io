Metal music has undergone a remarkable evolution over the decades, starting with the groundbreaking riffs of Black Sabbath in 70s, the pioneers of heavy metal, and expanding into the diverse and skillful artistry of today’s modern metal scene. In this article, we’ll take an in-depth look at how the lyrical themes in metal music have developed and transformed by analyzing the top 50 user-rated albums from each decade.

## Methodology

<br>

### 1. Data Collection

- Top 50 albums of each decade were scraped from [AlbumOfTheYear.org](https://www.albumoftheyear.org/)
- Then, for each album the lyrics were retrieved using `lyricsgenius` package and then cleaned up using custom scripts.

### 2. Data Analysis

- Python library, `nltk` was used to analyze sentiment of songs.
- Wordclouds generated using `wordcloud` library.

## Comparison Across Decades

<p style="text-align:center; font-size: 12px"><i>Fig. 1 - Wordcloud across decades. By observing the most dominant words, we can infer common themes or cultural trends that were influential in each decade. We can also detect linguistic shifts, although this won't be our focus in this case.</i></p>

The word cloud illustrates how heavy metal's roots trace back to the hard rock and blues in the 1970s. Notably, this is the only decade where themes of love are prominently featured. From a linguistic perspective, the 1970s also stand out for a higher frequency of words with vague or non-specific meanings, such as know, get, and take.

The 1980s and 1990s marked the golden era of thrash metal, dominated by iconic bands like Metallica, Death, Slayer, Iron Maiden, and Megadeth. The music from this period was intensely aggressive, often paired with lyrics that delved into themes like death, hell, destruction, pain, and blood. As evident from the word cloud, these words were a staple of heavy metal's lyrical landscape. Now _that's_ heavy metal!

But that’s not all that metal of the 1980s and 1990s had to offer. Beyond the high-energy and aggressive anthems, the era also featured numerous (_still heavy_) ballads that explored deeper themes like time, the essence of life, and the soul. This highlights that metal isn’t just about aggression; it is also a genre rich with introspection and reflection.

From the 2000s onward, metal evolved with the rise of sub-genres like nu metal, metalcore, deathcore, and djent. During this period, depressive and dark themes became increasingly prominent. Interestingly, the word "time" remains significant across each decade in the word cloud, but starting in the 2000s, other words like "life", "never", "away", and "can’t" suggest a shift towards a more negative and somber lyrical tone. The music began to paint a bleaker, more introspective picture.

That being said, it’s important to note that our analysis is based on the most popular albums, as rated by users. This means the findings are skewed towards the most well-known songs and may not fully represent the entire genre. Today, metal is incredibly diverse, offering something for everyone—from the most aggressive and brutal sounds to melodic and deeply introspective compositions.

<p style="text-align:center; font-size: 12px"><i>Fig. 2 - Setiment across decades</i></p>

When it comes to sentiment analysis, we can observe that the 1970s were the least negative of all decades. This isn’t surprising, as metal was still in its infancy and was heavily influenced by blues and hard rock (a point that I probably repeat a little bit too often).

The sentiment across other decades remains relatively similar, with the 1990s standing out as the most negative. It’s important to understand how sentiment is classified using the `NLTK` library: the system evaluates sentiment based on the presence of certain words in the lyrics. If a song features more negative words, it is classified as having a negative sentiment, and vice versa.

Higher level of negative sentiment doesn’t necessarily mean the song is more depressing; it could also reflect themes of aggression or anger. Since this classification system is designed primarily for general text, it isn’t perfect for analyzing song lyrics. Nonetheless, it provides a useful general idea of how sentiment in metal music has evolved over the decades.

## In-Depth Analysis of Decades

<br>

### The 70s

70s is considered by most people the very beginning of metal music, with _Black Sabbath_ being the first band to be classified as heavy metal. As we can see in top albums of the 70s, first of all - we don't even have 50 albums classified in this genre.
Let's take look at them:

| rank | artist        | album                            | year |
| ---- | ------------- | -------------------------------- | ---- |
| 1    | Black Sabbath | Paranoid                         | 1970 |
| 2    | Black Sabbath | Master of Reality                | 1971 |
| 3    | Black Sabbath | Black Sabbath                    | 1970 |
| 4    | Rainbow       | Rising                           | 1976 |
| 5    | Black Sabbath | Black Sabbath Vol                | 1972 |
| 6    | Black Sabbath | Sabbath Bloody Sabbath           | 1973 |

| 8    | Budgie        | Never Turn Your Back on a Friend | 1973 |
| 9    | Van Halen     | Van Halen                        | 1978 |
| 10   | Motörhead     | Overkill                         | 1979 |
| ..   | ..            | ..                               | ..   |
| 33   | Accept        | Accept                           | 1979 |

The genre in early 70s was still in its infancy. Later in this decade, bands like _Judas Priest_ and _Motörhead_ started to shape the genre into what we know today. Some of the lyrics in 70s were dark and introspective, often reflecting the social and political turmoil of the time.

### The 80s

The 1980s was a pivotal era in the evolution of metal music. The genre truly began to take shape and diversify.
This decade saw the emergence of legendary bands such as Metallica, Iron Maiden, Slayer, Megadeth and Death.
Each of them, and many more of those years, left an indelible mark on the metal landscape.
Let's see the top 10 albums of 1980s:

| rank | artist      | album                        | year |
| ---- | ----------- | ---------------------------- | ---- |
| 1    | Metallica   | Master of Puppets            | 1986 |

The sheer number of influential bands from this period makes it nearly impossible to list them all.
The 1980s were a time of experimentation and innovation, with bands pushing the boundaries of what metal could be.

## The 90s

In the 90s, trends from the 80s continued to evolve. To me personally, 90s are about the emergence of extreme metal sub-genres like death metal and its varieties,
and one of my favorite subgenres - progressive metal. Here are top 10 albums of the decade:

| rank | artist                   | album                     | year |
| ---- | ------------------------ | ------------------------- | ---- |
| 1    | Death                    | Symbolic                  | 1995 |
| 2    | Death                    | The Sound of Perseverance | 1998 |
| 3    | Rage Against the Machine | Rage Against the Machine  | 1992 |
| 4    | TOOL                     | Ænima                     | 1996 |
| 5    | Death                    | Human                     | 1991 |
| 6    | Alice in Chains          | Dirt                      | 1992 |
| 7    | Megadeth                 | Rust in Peace             | 1990 |
| 8    | System of a Down         | System of a Down          | 1998 |
| 9    | Opeth                    | Still Life                | 1999 |
| 10   | Nine Inch Nails          | Broken                    | 1992 |

_You can see the full list [here](https://www.albumoftheyear.org/ratings/user-highest-rated/1990s/metal/), or the full dataset in my [GitHub repo](https://github.com/jradziejewski/song-lyric-analysis/blob/main/albums_data.xlsx)._

Metal of this era was heavily influenced by a lot of genres, such as _grunge_, and even _hip-hop_.
The diversity of incluences is reflected in the lyrics.
Words that point to more introspective themes, such as _“time” “life”, "mind" and “soul”_ suggest that the music of the 90s was more reflective. Even when the music remained aggressive, it often explored themes in less explicit way.

Genres like metalcore, deathcore and djent became increasingly popular in the 2000s.
A lot of genres also evolved. Some bands that were very influential in this era are one of my all-time favorites: _Mastodon_, _Gojira_ and _Opeth_.

## The 10s

The emergence of the internet has transformed music forever, opening up endless possibilities for artists and listeners alike. With streaming platforms, social media, and digital distribution, music has never been more accessible—or more overwhelming. This explosion of creativity has led to an unprecedented number of bands, albums, and genres, making it nearly impossible for me to keep up, let alone provide any meaningful insights. Instead, I’ll simply present the statistics from the 2010s and 2020s, leaving the rest up to you.

## Summary
In conclusion, the evolution of metal music over the decades reveals a genre that is as diverse as it is dynamic. From the blues-inspired, darkly introspective roots of Black Sabbath in the 1970s to the aggressive, high-energy thrash metal of the 1980s and 1990s, and further into the depressive, introspective tones of the 2000s and beyond, metal has continually adapted to reflect the cultural and emotional landscapes of its time. 

The lyrical themes, as illustrated through word clouds and sentiment analysis, have shifted from vague and love-centric in the 1970s to more explicit, aggressive, and eventually darker and more reflective in later decades. Despite these changes, certain themes like "time" and "life" have remained consistent, underscoring the genre's enduring focus on existential and introspective exploration. While the analysis is based on popular albums and may not capture the full breadth of the genre, it highlights metal's remarkable ability to evolve while maintaining its core identity. Today, metal stands as a testament to the power of music to express the full spectrum of human emotion, from rage and despair to hope and transcendence, offering something for every listener in its vast and ever-expanding universe.
