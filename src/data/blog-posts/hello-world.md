I finally did something I've been thinking about for a long time: started my own blog. Now you're reading my first post!

## Why did I even do it?

To be honest, I never considered myself a writer.
Well, I got some decent grades on my school essays back in the day, but I'm not sure that counts for much.

Recently though, it hit me: **knowledge doesn't just magically appear on the internet**. For us to learn, someone has to create and share it. *(I mean, I knew that, but it somehow didn't reach my conscious mind I guess)*

I have consumed so much wisdom from other people over the years (*and I'm probably still doing it, somewhere in my basement as you read it!*). I used my *two ears* to listen - it's time to use my *one
mouth* (or *keyboard*) to share. 

Besides, I know how inspiring small, personal projects can be. Some of my biggest "aha!" moments have come from stumbling across random side projects or blogs by people I've never met. If this space can inspire even one person to get creative or try something new, I'll consider it a win. **Mega big win**, even.

Thanks for being here, and I hope you find something of value in what I share.
