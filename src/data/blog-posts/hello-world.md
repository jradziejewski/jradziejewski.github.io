I finally did something I've been thinking about for a long time: started my own blog. Now you're reading my first post!

## Why did I even do it?

I never considered myself a writer.
Well, I received some decent grades on my school essays, but besides that I never thought much about it.
However, as I'm growing older, and my thoughts and ideas are expanding,
I started thinking that some people could benefit from my discoveries.


> We have two ears and one mouth so that we can listen twice as much as we speak.
>
> -- <cite>Epictetus</cite>

This quote holds a special place in my heart. I love learning from others,
but I've come to realize that for us to learn, some have to produce knowledge.
I have consumed a great deal of wisdom from great people in the past, and now I want to use my metaphorical one
mouth to give some of it back. 

I won't be posting here daily, and maybe not even weekly, but every article will be crafted with Epictetus' wisdom in mind.
If you're interested in it, feel free to periodically check this website for new content.

Over time, I will develop some mechanism of notifying about new articles. Thanks for reading this and hope you'll find value here.
