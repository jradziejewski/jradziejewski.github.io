In this series of articles, we will be exploring guitar players I want to appreciate for many various reasons. There's no particular order in those articles, but I'll likely start with the musicians who inspired me to pick up the instrument in the first place. 

And of course, there can be no list of electric guitar players without Jimi Hendrix taking the top spot. 

## Legendary figure

> Jimi Hendrix was arguably the greatest instrumentalist in the history of rock music. 
> Hendrix expanded the range and vocabulary of the electric guitar into areas no musician had ever ventured before. 
> His boundless drive, technical ability and creative application of such effects as wah-wah and distortion forever transformed the sound of rock and roll."

## Revolutionary figure

In the late 1960s, by experimenting with distortion and feedback he pushed the boundaries of guitar sound. 
His use of fuzz pedals and overdrive laid foundations for the modern rock guitar tone.

But it wasn't just they way he amplificated the signal from his guitar - also his playing techniques were groundbreaking. 
He started fretting the low 6th string with his thumb, contrary to common barre chord technique.
This allowed him to sustain the root note while also playing melody, a method described as "piano style". 

Hendrix developed an ability to play rhythm chords and lead lines simultaneously, creating the impression that more than one guitarist was performing.

Aside from his technical innovations, he was self-taught also in terms of music theory. He probably did not understand much of it and still was able to come up with very well-made compositions. Compositions that millions of people still listen to today. In my opinion, this is a clear sign of genius.

<strong>The list of bands that Hendrix influenced can basically include every band that uses distorted guitars.</strong>

## My perspective

I won't pretend that I'm an expert in terms of Hendrix's style, his discography or anything really. What I know is that I was born into a world where the legacy of Jimi Hendrix is everywhere. I love rock and metal music, and much of it can be traced back to him.

While I don't listen to him daily, I often turn to his music when I’m in a need of inspiration. He’s a genius and the grandfather of the kind of music I love today.
